AJAX - Asyncronous javascript and XML

HTTP Request
Is a set od web development technique
using many web technologies on the "client-side"
to create asyncronous web applications

With ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asyncronouly(in the background).
without interfering with the display and behavious of the existing page.

We don't use data in XML format anymore.
We use json now

1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
2. fetch API (New way of doing)
3. axios (this is third party library)
