// declare const(constant)
// The const variable we cannot change once it declare we can play around with it but we can't change it.
// For eg:

const pi = 10.5;
console.log(pi);

// pi = 10;        This will throw error because we can't change the const value.

console.log(pi * 2 * 2);  // we can play with the const varaible but can't change.
