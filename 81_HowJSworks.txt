How javascript works:-

when we write code in javascript, js first compile a code and then execute.
1. Compilation ---> error and scoping
2. Execution ---> In order to execute js code js creates execution context. 1) Creation phase --> memory create(memory creation phase).
                                                                            2) Line by line code execution
what does this mean?
Means javascript 1st see the complete code and then start executing.

The compilation pase is divided in 3 part:-
Toxenizing/lexing - In toxenizing code gets divide into small small parts.
Parsing - and using that small parts of code js make AST(abstract syntax tree) AST make some kind of code which can beexecute later, early error checking.
Code generation - Code execution.

Example for how js complie his code first-
console.log("Hello world")
console.log("this")
var name = ."Veer";           

In this program js will not execute 15th and 16th line he will give error first on line no 17, because js compile the code 1st then start executing.
